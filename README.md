Introduction and Client Requirements

You work for an IT department. The company has purchased a new office space and has tasked you to project manage it. The new office space will need to be setup with both traditional workspace networked devices and smart IoT devices. You need to be able to install and configure the new office network meeting the needs of the client. The project needs to be completed within 4 days and requires the following:

•	Planning – you MUST create a plan on how your project will progress. This can be done using Gantt chart and Kanban Boards.

•	Design – you MUST use the below template to decide on the logical configuration of your network.

•	Implementation – you MUST use the Packet Tracer to set up and configure your network. This MUST also include the IoT devices.

•	Testing – you MUST show that your network and IoT equipment works by carrying out variety of tests.

•	Documenting – you MUST use this document to record your activities. You MUST also create a User Guide on how to use IoT Server, Wireless DHCP Router, and how to manually and dynamically assign IP to network devices.

•	Reviewing – you MUST review your project upon its completion.

Design Brief
The new office space requires the following: A total of 8 members of staff, 4 who are permanently in the office and 4 who are only in the office occasionally, (4 hot desks will therefore need to be set up for their devices). Each staff member requires a smart phone (you only need to include one in this project), and the ability to print using both a wireless and a wired printer. The business also wants you to add IoT devices to the network, such as, a coffee machine, a fan, a motion detector and a light. The IoT devices need to be connected to the IoT Server and managed via IoT Monitor App. 

Below is the breakdown of required equipment. You must decide on whether each equipment is dynamically or statically configured.

The network needs to consist of:
4 desktop PCs (CLIENTS) - 2 with static IP addresses and 2 with DHCP IP addresses
	2 printers (one must be wireless)

4 laptops with wireless connections to the network
	1 switch

All staff need wireless connections for their phones
	1 wireless router with DHCP enabled
SSID:		SmartOffice
Passphrase:	Office123

1 IoT Server
	4 IoT devices
